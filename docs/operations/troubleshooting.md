# Troubleshooting

Common failure modes, how to diagnose them, and how to fix them. Search
this page for the symptom you're seeing — the error messages are kept
verbatim so they match what `kubectl describe` shows.

---

## Triage flow

For any failing CR, the canonical diagnostic sequence is:

```bash
# 1. Phase + brief status
kubectl get sonarqube<kind> <name> -n <ns>

# 2. Conditions and Events
kubectl describe sonarqube<kind> <name> -n <ns>

# 3. Operator logs, filtered to this resource
kubectl logs -n sonarqube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sonarqube-operator \
  --tail=500 | grep -i <name>
```

The Events section in `describe` covers ~80% of issues. Read it before
diving into operator logs.

## Instance issues

### `Phase: Pending` for more than 2 minutes

The pod has not started yet. Inspect the StatefulSet:

```bash
kubectl get statefulset -n <ns>
kubectl describe pod <instance>-0 -n <ns>
```

Common causes:

- **PVC stuck in `Pending`** — No suitable StorageClass, no available
  PV, or quota exceeded. `kubectl describe pvc -n <ns>` for the
  reason.
- **Image pull failure** — Wrong `image.tag`, missing pull secret on a
  private registry. Look at the pod's `Events`.
- **Insufficient resources** — Cluster can't fit `requests.memory: 2Gi`.
  `kubectl describe nodes` to check capacity.

### `Phase: Progressing`, pod is `Running`, but not `Ready` after 5 minutes

SonarQube is starting but `/api/system/status` is not yet `UP`. Look at
the SonarQube container logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n <ns> <instance>-0 -c sonarqube --tail=200
```

Common causes:

- **`vm.max_map_count is too low`** — Elasticsearch refuses to start.
  Either ensure the privileged init container ran (default), or set
  `spec.skipSysctlInit: true` and configure the sysctls on the node
  via DaemonSet / MachineConfig. See
  [`SonarQubeInstance.spec.skipSysctlInit`](../reference/crds/sonarqubeinstance.md#skipsysctlinit).
- **Database connection refused** — `spec.database.host` unreachable
  from the SonarQube pod. Test with `kubectl exec` and `nc -vz <host>
  <port>`.
- **Wrong PostgreSQL credentials** — SonarQube logs show
  `password authentication failed`. The Secret in `database.secretRef`
  must have keys `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` matching the
  database.
- **Database schema mismatch** — A previous instance ran a different
  SonarQube major version against the same DB and the schema is from
  9.x while the new instance is 10.x (or vice versa). Either upgrade,
  or restore the matching backup.

### `Phase: Degraded`

The instance was previously `Ready` but is now failing health checks.
The Pod may still be running but unresponsive. Common causes:

- **JVM crash** — `kubectl logs` shows a stack trace, then nothing.
  Often caused by under-provisioned memory limits. Bump `resources.limits.memory`.
- **Disk full** — `df -h` from inside the pod. The data PVC fills up
  with Elasticsearch indexes; bump `spec.persistence.size` (only works
  if the StorageClass supports volume expansion).
- **PostgreSQL down** — The operator can't reach the database. Check
  the database operator's status.

### Admin password rotation has no effect

The admin password is read **once**, on first start of the instance,
to bootstrap the SonarQube admin account. Updating the value in the
Secret afterward does **not** rotate the password — see the
[`adminSecretRef` warning](../reference/crds/sonarqubeinstance.md#adminsecretref).

To rotate, change the password through the SonarQube UI (or
`POST /api/users/change_password`), then update the Secret to the new
value so a future re-bootstrap (e.g. after a PVC wipe) works.

---

## Plugin issues

### Plugin stuck in `Phase: Installing`

Most often: the SonarQube restart hasn't happened or hasn't completed.

```bash
# Check the instance's RestartRequired flag
kubectl get sonarqubeinstance <instance> -n <ns> \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.restartRequired}'

# If true, the instance controller should be acting on it. Look at logs:
kubectl logs -n sonarqube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sonarqube-operator \
  | grep -i restart
```

If `restartRequired` is `false` but the plugin shows `Installing` for
several minutes, the operator is probably waiting for SonarQube to
acknowledge the install. SonarQube takes a few seconds after restart to
reload its plugins; usually self-resolves.

### Plugin install fails with `Plugin not found`

`spec.key` is wrong. Plugin keys aren't always intuitive:

| Common name | Actual key |
|---|---|
| Java analyzer | `java` (not `sonar-java`) |
| Python | `python` |
| C# | `csharp` |
| Git SCM | `scmgit` |
| GitHub Auth | `authgithub` |

See [Find a plugin's key](../how-to/install-plugins.md#find-a-plugins-key).

### SonarQube refuses to start after a plugin install

The plugin is incompatible with this SonarQube version. Recovery:

1. Find the offending plugin file in the extensions PVC:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <instance>-0 -n <ns> -- ls /opt/sonarqube/extensions/plugins
   ```
2. Remove it manually:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <instance>-0 -n <ns> -- \
     rm /opt/sonarqube/extensions/plugins/sonar-foo-1.2.3.jar
   ```
3. Restart SonarQube:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart statefulset/<instance> -n <ns>
   ```
4. Once back up, delete the broken `SonarQubePlugin` CR or pin it to a
   compatible version.

## Project / quality gate issues

### Project `Phase: Failed`, message "instance not Ready"

The target `SonarQubeInstance` is not in `Ready` phase yet. The project
controller waits for it. Once the instance flips to `Ready`, the project
reconciles automatically — no action needed.

### `qualityGateRef` doesn't take effect

Two checks:

1. The `SonarQubeQualityGate` referenced exists in the **same namespace**
   as the project.
2. The gate's `spec.instanceRef` targets the **same instance** as the
   project.

If both are true and it still doesn't work, look at the project's
events:

```bash
kubectl describe sonarqubeproject <name> -n <ns>
```

### Quality gate condition keeps coming back after I delete it via UI

Working as designed — that's drift correction. The operator owns the
spec and reverts manual changes. To remove a condition permanently,
delete it from `spec.conditions[]` and apply.

---

## User issues

### User can't log in after creation

Three common causes:

- **Wrong password** — `passwordSecretRef` must have key `password`. Check
  the Secret's data:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret <name> -n <ns> -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
  ```
- **No password set + no SMTP configured** — When `passwordSecretRef` is
  omitted, SonarQube generates a random password. The user is supposed
  to receive a reset email. If SMTP isn't configured on the SonarQube
  instance, the email is never sent and the user can't access the
  account. Either configure SMTP, or set `passwordSecretRef`.
- **External auth in use** — With LDAP/SAML/OAuth configured, local
  passwords don't authenticate. Users have to use the IDP.

---

## Operator issues

### Operator pod CrashLoopBackOff

```bash
kubectl logs -n sonarqube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sonarqube-operator --previous
```

Most common: RBAC issue (missing permission on a resource). The
`make manifests` regeneration would have caught it pre-release; if you
see it on a published version, file an issue.

### Reconciliations very slow

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  sum by (controller, le) (rate(sonarqube_operator_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)
```

If p95 latency climbs above ~5s:

- **Slow SonarQube** — The operator waits on REST calls. Check
  SonarQube's own response times (`/api/system/info` exposes timings).
- **Rate limiting kicking in** — On error, the operator backs off
  exponentially (500ms → 5min). A burst of failed reconciles inflates
  apparent latency.
- **API server slow** — `kubectl get nodes` slow too? The cluster API
  server is overloaded; not specific to this operator.

### Workqueue depth growing

```promql
workqueue_depth{name=~".*sonarqube.*"}
```

A persistently growing depth means the operator can't keep up. Check:

- Are reconciles failing repeatedly (`rate(sonarqube_operator_reconcile_errors_total[5m])`)?
- Is a single resource thrashing (re-enqueued every cycle)?

For a one-off catch-up, restart the operator:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deploy/sonarqube-operator -n sonarqube-system
```

The new pod rebuilds the workqueue from a fresh list and processes the
backlog with a clean state.

## Webhook issues

### `failed to call webhook: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

The validating webhook is enabled but its TLS cert isn't trusted by the
API server. Causes:

- **cert-manager not installed** — Required when
  `webhook.certManager.enabled: true` (chart default). Install it via
  the official Helm chart.
- **Certificate not issued yet** — On a fresh install, cert-manager
  takes a few seconds to issue the cert. Re-apply the failing manifest
  after ~30s.
- **`caBundle` not injected** — When `webhook.certManager.enabled: false`,
  you must provide the CA bundle yourself via `webhook.caBundle`. See
  [`webhook` reference](../reference/helm-values.md#validating-webhook).

### Webhook blocks every admission with a generic error

Set `webhook.failurePolicy: Ignore` (the chart default) so a misbehaving
webhook doesn't take down the API server's admission path. Then dig into
the webhook logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n sonarqube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sonarqube-operator \
  | grep webhook
```

## When to file an issue

If you've followed the triage flow and still can't pin it down, open an
issue at
[https://github.com/BEIRDINH0S/sonarqube-operator/issues](https://github.com/BEIRDINH0S/sonarqube-operator/issues)
with:

- Operator version (`kubectl get deployment sonarqube-operator -n sonarqube-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'`)
- Kubernetes version (`kubectl version --short`)
- The CR manifest you applied (redact secrets)
- The output of `kubectl describe` on the failing resource
- The last ~200 lines of operator logs around the failure
